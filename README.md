# David Chau's Personal Website
This project, made in my CSC 412: Advanced Software Lab class, serves as an entry point to creating
websites and acts as my personal website. I will be continually updating it to fit as another way 
of showcasing my resume and my skills as I continue to learn more web development skills.
